            <p class="myInfo">My name is Stephany, and I am currently learning how to code through DU's Coding Bootcamp. I have a B.F.A in Digital Design and have always liked coding although I may not fully understand it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope to use the skills in this class to be able to receive a job in UX/UI design.

            One of my favorite things to do is to go out on long walks with my dog. I also enjoy going hiking and taking on new trails</p>
